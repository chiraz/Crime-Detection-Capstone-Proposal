# Introduction

This project aims to visualize, map, and analyze crime trends in Tunisia based only on text scraped from online news media articles. 

Indeed, identifying, understanding and dealing with crime and social violence are important to public officials, policy makers, urban planners, civil society, researchers, etc.  On the other hand, online news media stories are a rich source of information about crime that can be readily exploited for this purpose.


# Data

The data for this project consists of news articles automatically scraped from about popular Tunisian news websites and portals from the past few years. A sample of over 1000 such articles scraped from the daily newspaper "Assarih" in already available in the data folder.


# Methodology

At a high level, the main tasks of this project are to extract geographical patterns of crime (distribution of crime by location; 
identifying crime hot spots at the city and national levels), and temporal trends (how crime evolves over time; identifying seasonal 
patterns and exceptional spikes).Extracting such patterns from raw text data will require various natural text processing and machine 
learning tasks, mainly information extraction, aggregation, clustering, and time series analysis.

It is worth mentioning that working with Arabic language text adds an extra level of difficulty to this project because there are far 
less advanced NLP resources and tools for the Arabic than English.
